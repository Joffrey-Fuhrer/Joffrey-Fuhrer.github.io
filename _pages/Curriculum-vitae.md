<p><strong>Fuhrer, J.</strong>, Bezat, M., & Cova, F. <em>The everyday experience of meaning in life: an empirical perspective on what it is like to experience oneâ€™s life as meaningful or meaningless</em>. (Mixed methods: two qualitative studies and one quantitative study; paper written but not submitted yet.)<br>
  <strong>Phase:</strong> Written, not ready to be submitted.<br>
  <strong>Content:</strong> We all sometimes experience moments where our life feels meaningful or meaningless. But in which situations do these experiences arise? How do we feel? Our findings suggest that the experience of meaningfulness is about others: it occurs in situations where we are bonding with others, having a positive impact on our surroundings or on society, and helping others. The positive emotions associated with this experience include being moved, feeling part of a whole, being touched, feeling grateful, proud, motivated, experiencing awe, and feeling enlightened. Conversely, we tend to feel that our life is meaningless in situations where we feel unfulfilled, lack connections, feel useless, struggle with our mental health, experience negative emotions, or face a lack of direction in life. The negative emotions include feeling lost, sad, powerless, stressed, overwhelmed, and devastated.</p>
